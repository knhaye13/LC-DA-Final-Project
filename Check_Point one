As a previous leader of front line staff and ambassador of employee engagement activities one of my go toâ€™s for connection or boosting team morale were personality tests. They provide language to connect, discuss commonalities and safe spaces to discuss differences.

 I chose this dataset because it elevates the individual  Myers Briggs  personality test results by  also including data about their  posture  and   raises  the question: Is there a relationship between Posture and Personality traits?
